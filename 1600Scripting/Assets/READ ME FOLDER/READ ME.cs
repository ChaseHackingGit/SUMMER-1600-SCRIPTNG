 * THE PREMISE OF RANDAL RED(OPTIONAL):
The game is a top down style game, where the player takes on the roll of a western bandit.
Your objective as a bandit, is to steal all the loot in the town (represented as purple coins).
Successfully collecting all the coins will beat the game.
However, this is easier said than done.
The townsfolk have held a town meeting, and have all agreed to hunt you down, to stop your awful behavior. 
These Ai Townsfolk will chase you in an attempt to capture you.
Getting touched by one of the Townsfolk will have you “caught” and result in a GAME OVER.
The Townsfolk come in many shapes and sizes (represented as either a pawn, a trickster, or a brute).
Depending on what the size/color the Townsfolk will be, will decide how fast they can run, so beware. 
BRUTES are large green Townsfolk, they are slower than the standard yellow PAWNS Townsfolk, but are much larger,
making them more difficult to avoid. The thin blue colored Townsfolk are the TRICKSTERS,
they are thin, but much faster than the other two types, so look out. 
Fortunately, you are a man who has no sympathy for the weak, frail, and unarmed. 
Naturally as a result of this, you are supplied with a gun.
You can shoot the Townsfolk to eliminate them. Because there are only so many people in this town, 
they’ll eventually stop coming, so if you like, you can get out of this alive, 
with the only consequences being that you will live your live as a mass murderer.
One drawback to this however, is that you many only shoot facing forward, you cannot shoot in any other direction,
so there’s certainly still a chance that the Townsfolk will catch you. 
	It is also possible to jump, which can be used to escape corners, or hide on top of houses like a wuss,
	keep in mind the Townsfolk will continue to spawn while you camp like a sissy, so when you decide to jump down,
	be prepared to face the consequences. 
		One thing to keep in mind, is the county line at the back of the map, 
		if you step behind this line (represented as a white wall)
		You will be granted a powerup, that increases the speed of your ammo. 
			If you can manage to break into the town meeting,
			you can activate a powder keg, which will eliminate all of the Townsfolk currently outside. 

			Good Luck!
